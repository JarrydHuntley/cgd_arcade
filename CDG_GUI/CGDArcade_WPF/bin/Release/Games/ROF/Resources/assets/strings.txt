# Greetings

campmaster greeting:
Greetings, I trust your long gatejump from Winterhall was not too unpleasant. I see you've purchased the exploration and salvage rights for the area east of the camp. The governor probably already explained this to you, but I'll go over it again. The glyphs that were tattooed onto your body will prevent you from exploring any area outside of your charter. The glyphs are tied to a network of devices set up by the governor's men. I've marked this confinement zone on your map. This is to keep you treasure hunters honest. Good luck!

campmaster advice:
As you gain experience as a treasure hunter, be sure that your equipment is keeping pace, especially your armor and primary weapon. You can upgrade your equipment at the workbench, or buy new equipment. Some of the best gear, however, is found in the dungeons. You will also need to keep improving your spells, but that's the professor's area of expertise. 

professor greeting:
Hello, and welcome to the new realms. I sell a variety of spells and formulas to aid treasure hunters, and can identify any items that you might find. As you gain experience, I can also help you improve your spells.

professor advice:
If you need money, try collecting plants and using your alchemy kit to brew potions. These potions can then be sold to myself or the campmaster.

# Tent Repair

Some of the tents are getting a little worn out, and campers are complaining about the drafts. If you could sell me some deer pelts, it would be a big help.

# Journal

recover journal:
You have proven yourself to be a superb fighter and a skilled archaeologist. You may be able to help me out. The previous treasure hunter working this region was a friend of mine. He confided to me that he was very close to finding something big. Sadly, I believe he was killed by the local goblin chief before he could complete his work. I could make it worth your while if you could retrieve my friend's journal. I can't remove the magical glyphs that the governor tattooed onto your body, but I can secretly alter your confinement zone and let you explore as far as the goblin's lair. Tell no one of our deal. I've updated your map with the lair's location.

recover journal turnin:
Thank you so much for returning it. You have shown yourself to be someone I can trust. I will read over this journal and tell you what I find.

# Tablet

recover tablet:
It seems my friend was preparing for an expedition to the mountains in the east. He was searching for some sort of tablet, and his journal already contains the key to decode it. I'll expand your confinement zone further and update your map with the location where he believed the tablet to be.

recover tablet turnin:
Excellent work. I will decode the tablet using the key in my friends journal.

# Onyx Key

recover key:
This is big, really big. The tablet is a direct clue to finding something known as "The Book of Ancient Lies". I've seen it mentioned in some of my other research, and I believe it is a spellbook, or possibly a manual for constructing powerful ancient technology. We can not go to the governor with this information, he will betray us. I've known the governor since the Gatestone Wars. He is a cruel man with an insatiable lust for power. He is also a spellcaster of unmatched abilities. I will keep working on expanding your confinement zone while you search for the next piece of the puzzle, an onyx "key". I have marked a probable location on your map.

recover key turnin:
Excellent work. I will examine this artifact.

# Recover Book

recover book:
The onyx key you found will allow me to open a remote gatestone near the the location of the book we are seeking. I strongly advise against reading from this book on your own. When other ancient texts refer to something as "The Book of Ancient Lies", I'm guessing there is more to it then we are prepared for. Wait until we are in a proper laboratory environment. Also, here is a formula from my friend's journal called "Cure Disease" and a spell called "Elemental Shield". They will be important to recovering the book.

recover book turnin:
...

read book:
You decide to read through the book. The actual title is "Combined Knowledge of Nations Seeking Peace". Most of it is well beyond your skill level, but you do manage to learn a new formula called "Create Wight". Another item of interest is something called a "Difference Engine" which appears to be a mechanical computing device used for military tactical planning. There is also a more complex version of "Create Wight" called "Create Father Wight". If you make it through this alive, it will be exciting to try out everything this book has to offer.

# Defeat Governor

defeat governor:
... cough ... my friend ... cough ... we were betrayed by the campmaster. I'm afraid you've walked into a trap. Your confinement zone was just reduced to the area around this camp site. The campmaster is fetching the governor now, and he'll be here any minute. Don't let him have the book! Do whatever you must to defeat him! Perhaps ... cough ... there is something in the book that could save you. (Professor dies)
